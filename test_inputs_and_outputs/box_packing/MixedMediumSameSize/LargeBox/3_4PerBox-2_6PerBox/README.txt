Packing decision
- 4-per-box medium quantity: 3 -> ceil(3/4) = 1 cartons
- 6-per-box medium quantity: 2 -> ceil(2/6) = 1 cartons
- Total mixed-medium pieces: 5
- Resulting box count (LargeBox): 2

Client directed us to keep different mediums in separate cartons. 4-per-box items (canvas/acoustic) always occupy a dedicated carton holding at most four pieces, and 6-per-box items (framed paper prints) occupy cartons holding at most six pieces. Large cartons follow the same limits even though the shell is deeper, because the client wants identical blocking/bracing.
